      <div class="glossary-content">
        <h4 id="cagr">CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          The annualized growth rate of your investment over the backtest period. It represents the constant yearly rate 
          that would yield the same total return. Formula: <code>CAGR = (Ending Value / Starting Value)^(1 / Years) - 1</code>
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Example:</strong> A CAGR of 15% means your portfolio would grow by 15% per year on average. 
          This is the most important metric for comparing long-term strategy performance.
        </p>

        <h4 id="total-return">Total Return</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          The cumulative percentage return over the entire backtest period. 
          Formula: <code>Total Return = (Ending Equity / Starting Equity) - 1</code>
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Example:</strong> A total return of 150% means your initial investment increased by 150%, 
          so $100,000 became $250,000.
        </p>

        <h4 id="pnl">PnL (Profit and Loss)</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          The absolute dollar amount gained or lost over the backtest period. This is simply the difference 
          between ending equity and starting equity.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Note:</strong> While useful for understanding absolute gains, PnL doesn't account for risk 
          or the time value of money, so CAGR and Sharpe are better for strategy comparison.
        </p>

        <h4 id="max-drawdown">Max Drawdown (MDD)</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          The largest peak-to-trough decline in equity during the backtest period. This measures the worst 
          loss you would have experienced from a previous high point.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Example:</strong> A max drawdown of -25% means at one point, your portfolio declined 25% 
          from its highest value. Lower drawdowns indicate more stable strategies.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Drawdown tests your risk tolerance. A strategy with 50% annual returns 
          but -60% drawdown might be psychologically unbearable, causing you to abandon it at the worst time.
        </p>

        <h4 id="sharpe">Sharpe Ratio</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          A risk-adjusted return metric that measures excess return per unit of risk (volatility). 
          Formula: <code>Sharpe = (Mean Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Std Dev of Returns</code>
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Interpretation:</strong>
          <br>• Sharpe < 1.0: Poor risk-adjusted returns
          <br>• Sharpe 1.0-2.0: Good risk-adjusted returns
          <br>• Sharpe 2.0-3.0: Very good risk-adjusted returns
          <br>• Sharpe > 3.0: Exceptional risk-adjusted returns
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Example:</strong> A Sharpe of 2.5 means you're earning 2.5 units of return for every unit 
          of risk taken. Higher is always better.
        </p>

        <h4 id="trades"># Trades</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          The total number of round-trip trades (buy and sell pairs) executed during the backtest period.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> More trades mean higher transaction costs and potentially more 
          complexity. A strategy with 500 trades vs. 50 trades needs to generate enough extra return to 
          justify the additional costs and effort.
        </p>

        <h4 id="win-rate">Win % (Win Rate)</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          The percentage of trades that were profitable. Formula: <code>Win Rate = (Winning Trades / Total Trades) × 100</code>
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Important note:</strong> Win rate alone is misleading. A strategy with 90% win rate but small 
          wins and large losses can still lose money. Always consider win rate alongside average win/loss size.
        </p>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h4 id="signal">Signal (-1, 0, +1)</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          The trading recommendation produced by each strategy:
          <br>• <strong>+1 (BUY):</strong> Strategy indicates a long position should be taken
          <br>• <strong>0 (HOLD):</strong> Strategy indicates holding current position or staying in cash
          <br>• <strong>-1 (SELL):</strong> Strategy indicates closing positions or taking a short position
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Aggregation:</strong> The final stock signal is computed by combining individual strategy signals 
          using either majority vote (most common signal wins) or weighted vote (each strategy's signal is weighted 
          by its performance metric, typically CAGR).
        </p>

        <h4 id="cooldown-bars">Cooldown Bars</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          The minimum number of time periods (bars) that must pass between consecutive trades. This parameter 
          prevents overtrading and reduces transaction costs.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Example:</strong> With cooldown_bars=5 on daily data, after selling a position, the strategy 
          must wait at least 5 days before buying again.
        </p>

        <h4 id="window">Window / Lookback Period</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          The number of historical bars used to calculate an indicator. Different indicators use different windows:
          <br>• <strong>RSI Window:</strong> Typically 14 periods (14 days for daily data)
          <br>• <strong>MA Window:</strong> Can vary from 20 (short-term) to 200 (long-term)
          <br>• <strong>Bollinger Window:</strong> Typically 20 periods
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Trade-off:</strong> Shorter windows react faster to price changes but generate more false signals. 
          Longer windows are smoother but slower to respond to trend changes.
        </p>

        <h4 id="rsi">RSI (Relative Strength Index)</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          A momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of price changes, ranging from 0 to 100.
          <br>• <strong>RSI > 70:</strong> Traditionally considered "overbought" (potential sell signal)
          <br>• <strong>RSI < 30:</strong> Traditionally considered "oversold" (potential buy signal)
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Parameters:</strong>
          <br>• <code>rsi_window</code>: Lookback period (commonly 14)
          <br>• <code>rsi_overbought</code>: Upper threshold (commonly 70)
          <br>• <code>rsi_oversold</code>: Lower threshold (commonly 30)
        </p>

        <h4 id="macd">MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          A trend-following momentum indicator showing the relationship between two moving averages.
          <br>• <strong>Signal:</strong> Buy when MACD line crosses above signal line; sell when it crosses below
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Parameters:</strong>
          <br>• <code>macd_fast_window</code>: Fast EMA period (commonly 12)
          <br>• <code>macd_slow_window</code>: Slow EMA period (commonly 26)
          <br>• <code>macd_signal_window</code>: Signal line EMA period (commonly 9)
        </p>

        <h4 id="bollinger">Bollinger Bands</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          Volatility bands placed above and below a moving average. Price touching the upper band may indicate 
          overbought conditions; touching the lower band may indicate oversold conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Parameters:</strong>
          <br>• <code>bb_window</code>: Moving average period (commonly 20)
          <br>• <code>bb_k</code>: Number of standard deviations for band width (commonly 2.0)
        </p>

        <h4 id="sma">SMA (Simple Moving Average)</h4>
        <p class="muted">
          The average price over a specified number of periods. Commonly used for trend identification:
          <br>• <strong>Price > SMA:</strong> Potential uptrend (bullish)
          <br>• <strong>Price < SMA:</strong> Potential downtrend (bearish)
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>Parameters:</strong>
          <br>• <code>window</code>: Number of periods to average (commonly 50 or 200)
        </p>

        <hr class="divider">

        <p class="muted">
